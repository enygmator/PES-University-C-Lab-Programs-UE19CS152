 Students will learn to write functions, arrays and pointers

# write functions, arrays and pointers

## array.h
> The given programs use array printing and reading, so in order to reduce code, I have included an `array.h` file.


## 1. Write a function to display an array elements in the reverse order using a) index b) pointer

OUTPUT:
1. Enter size of array: 4  
3 5 7 9  
3 5 7 9   
9 7 5 3   
3 5 7 9  
2. Enter size of array: 3
2 4 6  
2 4 6   
6 4 2   
2 4 6  

## 2) Write a function to populate an array with fibonacci numbers.


OUTPUT:
1. terms in fibonacci series: 5  
0 1 1 2 3
2. terms in fibonacci series: 7  
0 1 1 2 3 5 8

## 3) Write a function to delete an element from an array at specified position.


OUTPUT:
1. Enter size of array: 5  
1 2 3 4 5  
1 2 3 4 5   
delete position (1-5): 4  
1 2 3 5  
2. nter size of array: 3  
1 2 3   
1 2 3   
delete position (1-3): 6  
invalid input  

## 4) Write a function to check whether the element in the array is odd parity or even parity and find the sum of digits with even parity


OUTPUT:
1. 4 9 15  
4 9 15   
Sum of digits with even parity is: 15  
2. Enter size of array: 5  
4 5 8 15 17  
4 5 8 15 17   
Sum of digits with even parity is: 19  

## 5) Given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in list. One of the integer is missing in the list. Write a function to find the missing integer.


OUTPUT:
1. Missing value in range is: 5

## 6) Write a function to add and subtract Two One Dimensional Array elements.


OUTPUT:
1. Enter size of array: 4  
1 2 3 4  
5 6 7 8  
Addtion of arrays: 6 8 10 12   
Subtraction of arrays: -4 -4 -4 -4
