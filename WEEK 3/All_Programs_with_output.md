3  
set : 0  
The number after clear is 17  

2. Enter the number which you want check  
23  
Input number is 23  
Enter the bit position, starts from zero  
0  
bit is set

The answer is: -1.000000  

3. Enter 2 numbers: 2 3  
What operation?*  
The answer is: 6.000000  

4. Enter 2 numbers: 2 3  
What operation?/  
The answer is: 0.666667  

5. Enter 2 numbers: 2 0  
What operation?/  
The answer is: Division by zero not possible  

## Program 6
