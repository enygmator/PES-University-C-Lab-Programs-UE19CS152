# Students will learn strings, pointers and usage of Multiple files

## 1.  Write functions to a) Reverse a string. b) Check for equality of strings. In  the  client  program,  use  these  functions  to  check  whether  the  given  string  is  a palindrome.

OUTPUT:  
1. Enter string: MalayalaM  
Reversed string is: MalayalaM  
The string is a palindrome  
2. Enter string: Malayalam  
Reversed string is: malayalaM  
The string is not a palindrome  
## 2. Write   a   function   to   extract   a   portion   of   character   string   and   print   the substring(extracted string)


OUTPUT:  
1. Enter string: what are YOU doing?  
Enter start index: 2  
Enter end index: 20  
The string is: what are YOU doing?  
Invalid input  
2. Enter string: what are YOU doing?  
Enter start index: 2  
Enter end index: 8  
The string is: what are YOU doing?  
The sub-string is: at are   
## 3. Write function to Concatenate two strings and use this to concatenate n (i.e, say 2) strings.


OUTPUT:  
1. Enter string 1: hello  
Enter string 2: WorlD  
Enter number of times to append: 2  
Concatenated string is: helloWorlDWorlD  
2. Enter string 1: what is  
Enter string 2: when  
Enter number of times to append: 0  
Concatenated string is: what is  
## 4. Write  function  to  replace  all  occurences  of  a  character  by  specific character  in  a String

OUTPUT:  
1. Enter string 1: what are anna and andrey doing?  
Original string: what are anna and andrey doing?  
Enter char to replace: a  
Enter new char: #  
Replaced string: wh#t #re #nn# #nd #ndrey doing?  
2. Enter string 1: fttk   
Original string: fttk  
Enter char to replace: t  
Enter new char: *  
Replaced string: f**k  

# Practise programs

## 5. Write a function to count the number of occurrences of a given character. Use this to find the number of occurrences of every character in a word.

OUTPUT:  
1. Enter string: obersturmbannfuhrer  
o : 1  
b : 2  
e : 2  
r : 4  
s : 1  
t : 1  
u : 2  
m : 1  
a : 1  
n : 2  
f : 1  
h : 1  
2. Enter string: hello  
h : 1  
e : 1  
l : 2  
o : 1  
## 6. Write the function strend (s , t ), which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the string s, and zero otherwise

OUTPUT:  
1. Enter string: hello  
Enter check string: llo  
Check is at the end of string  
2. Enter string: helloworld  
Enter check string: tld  
Check is not at the end of string
