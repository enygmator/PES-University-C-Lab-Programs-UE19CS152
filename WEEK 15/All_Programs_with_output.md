## 2. Write a C program to merge contents of two files into a third file. Hint: Create three files-2 files(file1.txt and file2.txt) with contents and third file(file3.txt) to mergecontents of other two files(file1.txt and file2.txt)
### Executed in CLI:
```
touch file1.txt
echo -e "Good Morning! \nThis is great! \nfile1" > file1.txt
touch file2.txt
echo -e "We love C programming\nfile 2" > file2.txt
touch file3.txt
```
