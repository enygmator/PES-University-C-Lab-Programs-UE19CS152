# All programs written this week with the output

## Objective

Students will learn control structures-Looping and Enumeration.

## Program 1

Write a program to check whether a number is prime

1. Find number of factors - if number of factors is 2, then the number is prime
2. Check whether any number from 2 to n - 1 divides the given number

**OUTPUT:**

1. Enter a number: 7  
The factors of 7 are: 1 7  
number is prime  
2. Enter a number: 16  
The factors of 16 are: 1 2 4 8 16  
number is not prime  

## Program 2

Write a program to output the following pattern:
pattern is in the solution.

**OUTPUT:**

Enter a number: 5  
  
1 = 1  
1 + 2 = 3  
1 + 2 + 3 = 6  
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15  

## Program 3

Write a program to check whether the given four digit number is PALINDROME or NOT

**Output:**

1. Enter a 4 digit number: 2323  
It is not palindrome  
2. Enter a 4 digit number: 2002  
It is palindrome

## Program 4

Write a program to compute Sin(x) using Taylor series approximation

**Output:**

1. Enter angle in degrees: 60  
sin(1.047067) is 0.865960
2. Enter angle in degrees: 90  
sin(1.570600) is 1.000000

## Program 5

Write a C program to find whether week day or week end using enum

**Output:**

1. Enter a 1 for input, any other key for exit\[  
2. Enter a 1 for input, any other key for exit1  
Enter a weekday number: 6  
It is weekend
3. Enter a 1 for input, any other key for exit1  
Enter a weekday number: 9  
invalid input
4. Enter a 1 for input, any other key for exit1  
Enter a weekday number: 3  
It is a weekday

## Program 6

Write a program to find sum of prime numbers between 1 to n

**Output:**

1. Enter a number: 7  
The sum of prime numbers from 1 to 7 is: 18

## Program 7

Write a program to output given pattern

**Output:**

```powershell
1. Enter a number: 6

          1  
        2 3 2  
      3 4 5 4 3  
    4 5 6 7 6 5 4
  5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5
6 7 8 9 10 11 10 9 8 7 6
```
